						<h2>seven for anne</h2>

						<h2>Devil's Advocate</h2>
						<p class="poetry">She’s so lovely, the translucent lace scarlet</p>
<p class="poetry">Braces at her knees. Prettier than me, so much</p>
<p class="poetry">Softer in the light,</p>
No wicked mirrors twisting her ecclesiastic skin
Into grey-pink scars, arms
Free of verses, only hushed and silenced goings
At the metal, heat to heat, I’ve never
Seen a prettier girl.
I’ve never seen a prettier girl in my whole life.
I am ugly, then, but I have
The words, and I have made a saint of her because it was
Her
Bed
That was undone, are you sure this is
What you choose?
And who brought you here
To this bridge? So many words
Cut and bleeding on the sidelines of the path
My broken fingers take
From your calves to your core—like soldiers
Astride a terrible fence in a terrible war,
Seemingly living—upright—but in reality,
Dead, their blood thick like a birthday cake.
Words that I whispered to you but
Disappeared in my deep pounding’s wake:
She’s better
If they stretched her out at 10-years-old
Like the Vaganova girls
She’d pass the test,
And I would fail--
I’m not as lithe
And not as frail.
She’d be a graduate, and I would
Go back to my village,
Disappointing my mother,
And regurgitating ink
All over the walls.

So
Choose
Carefully </p>

						<h2>Ars Poetica</h2>
						<p class="poetry">Keep your poetry</p>
						<p class="poetry">Far from decoration; it’s past the time</p>
						<p class="poetry">For sweet love songs and similes,</p>
						<p class="poetry">Like graveyards dug</p>
						<p class="poetry">By those who fill them</p>
						<p class="poetry">They are dead and gone.</p>
						<p class="poetry">New grass has covered them</p>
						<p class="poetry">And now</p>
						<p class="poetry">Couples weaving hands, weaving hearts,</p>
						<p class="poetry">Walk upon them, opposite direction</p>
						<p class="poetry">From the wind, planning</p>
						<p class="poetry">Their future</p>
						<p class="poetry">Atop the bones</p>
						<p class="poetry">Of 62 years ago</p>
						<br>
						<p class="poetry">Keep your poetry</p>
						<p class="poetry">Away from frills,</p>
						<p class="poetry">Pretty</p>
						<p class="poetry">Is no longer wanted</p>
						<p class="poetry">In this ring of jiving,</p>
						<p class="poetry">Smoothing fingers</p>
						<p class="poetry">Pressing in</p>
						<p class="poetry">Against words,</p>
						<p class="poetry">Keep away from alliteration or you’ll</p>
						<p class="poetry">End up all alone;</p>
						<p class="poetry">Rhymes are to be avoided at all costs,</p>
						<p class="poetry">Even if the syntax</p>
						<p class="poetry">Is calculated, and the accosted</p>
						<p class="poetry">Understood; even if the structure</p>
						<p class="poetry">Is sophisticated, carries</p>
						<p class="poetry">What’s lost the way</p>
						<p class="poetry">No other forms could.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="poetry">Place a swear word</p>
						<p class="poetry">In your poem, somewhere</p>
						<p class="poetry">In the middle&mdash;keep it scarce,</p>
						<p class="poetry">And connect it to reclaiming</p>
						<p class="poetry">Pride for your tribe that was prodded and stolen away,</p>
						<p class="poetry">Make sure to say</p>
						<p class="poetry">That the clearing was yours before it hit them.</p>
						<p class="poetry">That the buckling, undoing of peoples</p>

						<br>
						<p class="poetry">My grandmother</p>
						<p class="poetry">Is a gypsy&mdash;Roma&mdash;that’s good shit</p>
						<p class="poetry">To put in a poem. They were nomads</p>
						<p class="poetry">And tracked the woods</p>
						<p class="poetry">Looking for resting places, selling</p>
						<p class="poetry">Tokens and organs and sex</p>
						<p class="poetry">Compelling tales of hooded</p>
						<p class="poetry">Witches, eating scraps</p>
						<p class="poetry">Of childhood, spreading broken glass and blood</p>
						<p class="poetry">At the opening of doors, to bring</p> 
						<p class="poetry">Old lover back,</p>
						<p class="poetry">Spells to lull the rich</p>
						<p class="poetry">From the sinned mouth of the poor</p>
						<br>
						<p class="poetry">Not Jews, though.</p>
						<p class="poetry">That would be bullshit.</p>
						<p class="poetry">They wouldn’t even send you</p>
						<p class="poetry">A goddamn rejection letter.</p>
						<p class="poetry">Don’t say you’re a Jew,</p>
						<p class="poetry">But don’t cry out others’ injustice either</p>
						<p class="poetry">Lest it become</p>
						<p class="poetry">Your story and not theirs.</p>
						<p class="poetry">As if sorrow has kings and queens</p>
						<p class="poetry">And an owner and heirs.</p> 
						<p class="poetry">The rulebook is strict, but</p>
						<p class="poetry">It is very clear. And you can’t undo</p>
						<p class="poetry">Anything that’s been done</p>
						<p class="poetry">To rob and to rape, and it’s been</p>
						<p class="poetry">Long enough that’s it’s you who has won</p>
						<p class="poetry">Even though Treblinka seeps through generations</p>
						<p class="poetry">Like a faucet you cannot seem to turn hard enough</p>
						<p class="poetry">To keep it from trickling.</p>
						<p class="poetry">The maddening minds</p>
						<p class="poetry">Fine and ripe for the picking,</p>
						<p class="poetry">You’re not a dead poet,</p>
						<p class="poetry">So speak not of love whether death struck or kicking.</p>
						<p class="poetry">You haven’t the right</p>
						<p class="poetry">And not the most recent of agendas in your words so&mdash;</p>
						<p class="poetry">Sorrowful partings, it is not per our</p>
						<p class="poetry">Publishing policy, I fear,</p>
						<p class="poetry">Not quite exactly</p>
						<p class="poetry">What we were looking to hear.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="poetry">If you could, just remember that they’ve</p>
						<p class="poetry">Got the story, and if we tell their story,</p>
						<p class="poetry">We’re knaves, only here to be rid</p>
						<p class="poetry">Of our forefathers sin</p>
						<p class="poetry">Not that we’d listen</p>
						<p class="poetry">We would listen, we would,</p>
						<p class="poetry">But to honour the brave and the heaven</p>
						<p class="poetry">By telling our brethren</p>
						<p class="poetry">How to behave</p>
						<p class="poetry">Would be best, is what they said.</p>
						<p class="poetry">And it works: Everyone’s frightened,</p>
						<p class="poetry">And a girl with bright eyes was shot in the head</p>
						<p class="poetry">And the world is moving,</p>
						<p class="poetry">But it’s not Frost and Woolf anymore, so</p>
						<p class="poetry">You don’t get a word in here, darling</p>
						<p class="poetry">On what it is that lives</p>
						<p class="poetry">And what it is that is dead.</p>
